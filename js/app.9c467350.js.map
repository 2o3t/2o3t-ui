<code>otDefaultColors(theme)</code> .</p>\\n<p>可通过如下配置:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">import OTUIColors from '2o3t-css-colors/dist/2o3t-ui/index.js';\\nconst { setOptions, otMixin } = OTUIColors;\\n\\nsetOptions({\\n    color: 'primary', // 颜色\\n    theme: 'light', // 亮色\\n});\\nVue.mixin(otMixin);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>接着, 你就可以在所有组件中使用配色规则了. 下面提供一个🌰:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">otDefaultColors(theme) {\\n    switch (theme) {\\n        case 'dark':\\n            return {\\n                normal: [ 'def-f', 'def-b', 'border' ],\\n                hover: [ 'light-f-hov', 'def-bg-h', 'def-b-h' ],\\n                active: [ 'def-bg-a', 'def-b-a' ],\\n                selected: [ 'dark-f-s', 'def-bg-s' ],\\n                disabled: [ 'def-f-dis', 'def-bg-dis', 'def-b-dis' ],\\n            };\\n        case 'light':\\n        default:\\n            return {\\n                normal: [ 'def-f', 'def-bg', 'def-b' ],\\n                hover: [ 'light-f-hov', 'def-bg-hov', 'def-b-hov' ],\\n                active: [ 'def-bg-act', 'def-b-act' ],\\n                selected: [ 'light-f-s', 'def-bg-s' ],\\n                disabled: [ 'def-f-dis', 'def-bg-dis', 'def-b-dis' ],\\n            };\\n    }\\n},\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>在默认情况下, 你只需要定义一个 <code>otDefaultColors</code> 方法, 组件会默认帮你将所有 <code>default</code> 前缀的命名, 替换成其它配色方案, 并生成对应的方法注入, 如下:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>方法名</th>\\n<th>参数</th>\\n<th>备注</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>otDefaultColors</td>\\n<td>theme</td>\\n<td>默认配色(原色)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>otPrimaryColors</td>\\n<td>theme</td>\\n<td>主配色(主题色)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>otSuccessColors</td>\\n<td>theme</td>\\n<td>成功配色(辅助色)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>otWarningColors</td>\\n<td>theme</td>\\n<td>警告配色(辅助色)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>otDangerColors</td>\\n<td>theme</td>\\n<td>危险配色(辅助色)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>otInfoColors</td>\\n<td>theme</td>\\n<td>信息配色(辅助色)</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>整个栗子</h3>\\n<p>&lt;ot-notice color=&quot;info&quot;&gt;\\n在开发时, 请先使用 <code>v-bind</code>, 冲突时再选用 <code>v-ot-bind={}</code> 进行配置. 如果需要丢弃原组件配置则使用 <code>:ot-bind={}</code> .\\n&lt;/ot-notice&gt;</p>\\n<pre><code
